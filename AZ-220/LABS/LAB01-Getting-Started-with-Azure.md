# LAB01 - Getting Started with Azure
## Lab Scenario
You are an Azure IoT Developer for a leading gourmet cheese company named Contoso. Contoso evaluated the business opportunity for IoT and concluded that there are significant benefits that they can achieve. They selected Microsoft Azure IoT based on their evaluations.

> NOTE: You can run this entire lab from inside an Azure Virtual Machine, as described in the [pre-requisites](../README.md)

To get started, you need to become familiar with the Azure tools.
## In this lab
In this lab, you will become familiar with the Azure portal and different ways to access your Azure Resources. The lab includes the following exercises:
- Explore the Azure Portal
- Create an Azure Dashboard and Resource Group 
## Exercise 1: Examine the Azure Portal
### **Task 1: Examine the Azure portal Home page**
In this task, you will get familiar with the Azure portal. One of the things you can do is display a map of data center regions, and take a look at the service health.
### **Task 2: Examine the Azure Service options**
In this task, you have an opportunity to get familiar with different Azure Services. You can limit the number of services visible by limiting yourself to the **Internet of Things** catagory. As a task, highlight some some relevant services on your portal by adding them to your favourites:
- add the following services to your favorites: **IoTHub**, **Device Provisioning Services**, **Function App**, **Stream Analytics jobs**, and **Azure Cosmos DB**.
### **Task 3: Examine the Toolbar menu**
The Azure Portal also contains a Toolbar
Simply examine a number of items on the Azure Portal's Toolbar. For instance, try to learn more about **Billing** through **Help + Support**.
## Exercise 2: Create an Azure Dashboard and Resource Group
On the Azure portal, dashboards are used to present a customized view of your resources. Information is displayed through the use of tiles which can be arranged and sized to help you organize your resources in useful ways. You can create many different dashboards that provide different views and serve different purposes.

A resource group is a logical group that contains related resources for a project or application.

The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.

### **Task 1: Create a Dashboard**
From inside your Azure portal, create an empty dashboard with the following name: **AZ-220**.
### **Task 2: Create a Resource Group and add it to your Dashboard**
You can use the Resource Group you are about to create to store all different resources you will use throughout this series of LABs:
- Create a Resource Group with the name **AZ-220-RG**. Note that the Resource Group name must be unique within your subscription.
- Add the just created Resource Group to the Dashboard you created earlier.
