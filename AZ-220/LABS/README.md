# Structure of the Labs folder
Inside this folder you will find all 20 different labs. All lab descriptions are described in a scenario based way. If you want to fall back to the step-by-step instructions of the original AZ220 labs, references are available in the lab instructions.

For each lab that requires additional content (like source code files), separate folders exist under the **LabFiles** folder. The lab instructions point to the right folders to retrieve the additional content.
